Melanoma Cancer is a dangerous form of skin-cancer. Though, it is a rare form of skin-cancer but it is highly fatal. In this repo, we are training a Deep CNN for finding out if a lesion is cancerous or not. 
We use a pre-trained Inception Model to generate as a feature extractor since our dataset is relatively small.

This article explains the approach and the results in detail.



## Steps to train and test the model

The rest of the paper is organised as follows:


```bash
Section 2 details materials and proposed method.
```
```bash
Section 3 represents results and discussion.
```

```bash
Section 4 deploy the model using flask.
```

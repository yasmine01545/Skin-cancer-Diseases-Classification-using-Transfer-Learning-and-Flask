# Skin-cancer-Diseases-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-and-Flask
In this work, we propose a modified InceptionV3 model for the classification of skin cancer. We propose to use Transfer learning which is a common technique for deep learning that uses pre-trained models as VGG16 ,Inception as a starting point to speed up training and to enhance the deep learning model's performance in order to classify skin cancer with a better accuracy value compared to the state of the art.
